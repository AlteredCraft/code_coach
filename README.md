# Learn Python with AI ü§ñüêç

This is an early stage experiement to determine if Claude Code can be used to effectivly teach Python programming while building healthy AI collaboration skills. There is no "app" involved, just Claude Code, some markdown files, and CLAUDE.md files.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- VSCode with Claude Code extension
- GitHub account
- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager

### Setup
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone to your machine
3. Open in VSCode
4. Install uv if needed: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
5. Initialize the environment: `uv sync`
6. Start with [Lesson 1](modules/01-foundations/lessons/01-hello-ai/README.md) "Hello, I'm ready to start lesson one"

## How It Works

- Each lesson has exercises with skeleton solution files
- Your AI assistant guides you to discover solutions through questions
- You write your code in the solution files as you learn
- Run your code with `uv run python solution/filename.py`
- Check code quality with `uv run ruff check solution/filename.py`
- Your progress is tracked automatically across sessions

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Foundations
- Lesson 1: Hello World - Your first Python programs
- Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types (Coming Soon)
- Lesson 3: Control Flow (Coming Soon)
- Lesson 4: Functions (Coming Soon)
- Lesson 5: Error Handling (Coming Soon)

## Learning Philosophy

This course emphasizes:
- **Learning by doing** - Write real code from day one
- **Guided discovery** - Your AI mentor asks questions, not gives answers
- **Progressive building** - Each solution builds on what you've learned
- **Clean code habits** - Automatic linting ensures good practices
