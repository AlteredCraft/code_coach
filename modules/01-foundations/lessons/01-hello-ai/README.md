# Lesson 1: Hello World with AI Assistance

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Write and run your first Python program
- Understand when to use AI assistance appropriately
- Practice the reflect-attempt-verify cycle
- Document your learning process

## 📚 Pre-Reading

Before using any AI assistance, read through this entire lesson. Understanding the big picture helps you use AI more effectively.

## 🏃‍♂️ Exercise 1: Traditional Hello World

**Task**: Without using AI, write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!"

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint (try yourself first!)</summary>

Python has a built-in function for displaying text. It starts with 'p' and rhymes with "sprint".

</details>

**Reflection Questions** (answer in your journal):
1. How long did this take you?
2. What resources did you use?
3. What was challenging?

## 🤖 Exercise 2: Hello with Input

Now let's use AI assistance appropriately.

**Task**: Create a program that:
1. Asks the user for their name
2. Greets them personally

**Before asking AI**:
- [ ] Write down what you think you need to learn
- [ ] Attempt a solution (even if incomplete)
- [ ] Identify specific parts you're stuck on

**AI Usage Guidelines**:
- Ask for concepts, not complete code
- Good: "How do I get user input in Python?"
- Bad: "Write a program that asks for name and greets the user"

**After using AI**:
- [ ] Implement the solution yourself
- [ ] Test with different inputs
- [ ] Explain each line in comments

## 🔍 Exercise 3: Debugging Practice

The following code has intentional errors. Fix them WITHOUT asking AI for the solution.

```python
print("What's your favorite color?")
color = input()
print("Wow, color is a great color!")
```

You may ask AI:
- What error messages mean
- How specific Python features work
- General debugging strategies

You should NOT ask AI:
- "Fix this code"
- "What's wrong with this code?"

## 🏗️ Mini-Project: Personal Introduction Script

Create a program that:
1. Asks for user's name
2. Asks for their age  
3. Asks for their favorite programming language
4. Prints a formatted introduction

**Constraints**:
- Plan your approach BEFORE any AI consultation
- Use AI for at most 2 specific questions
- Document which parts you used AI for

## ✅ Lesson Completion

1. All exercises completed and working
2. Journal entry filled out (see template)
3. Create a GitHub issue using the "Lesson Complete" template

## 📝 Journal Prompt

In `/journal/lesson-01.md`, reflect on:
- What was the hardest part of limiting AI usage?
- How did attempting solutions first change your learning?
- What specific Python concepts do you now understand?
- Rate your confidence level (1-5) in writing basic Python

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've completed your first lesson! You've learned not just Python syntax, but how to learn programming effectively with AI as a tool rather than a crutch.
